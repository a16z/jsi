# jsi

just solve it - a command-line utility to run a portfolio of [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solvers in parallel.

## Highlights

- 🏆 acts as a "virtual best solver" by running multiple solvers in parallel and returning the result of the fastest solver
- 🔍 discovers available solvers on on the PATH at runtime
- 🛣️ runs solvers in parallel and monitors their progress
- ⏰ can terminate solvers early after a timeout
- 🔪 jsi can be interrupted by Ctrl-C and it will kill any solvers still running
- 🏎 runs with minimal startup time (<100ms), and also supports an experimental daemon mode with a rust client for extra low-latency (<10ms)
- 🖥️ supports macOS and Linux
- 🐍 supports Python 3.11+


## Getting Started

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to install jsi.

```sh
# install jsi
uv tool install jsi

# run it
jsi --help
```


## Features

### Configuration

This is how jsi finds and runs solvers:

- it first attempts to load custom solver definitions from `~/.jsi/solvers.json`
- if that file doesn't exist, it loads the default definitions from the installed package (see [src/jsi/config/solvers.json](src/jsi/config/solvers.json))

Based on these definitions, jsi knows what executables to look for, whether a given solver is enabled, how to enable model generation, etc.

Then:
- it looks up the solver cache in `~/.jsi/cache.json`
- if that file doesn't exist, it will scan the PATH and cache the results

It does this because scanning the PATH can be slow, but loading cached paths is 5x faster.

> [!TIP]
> `~/.jsi/cache.json` can always be safely deleted, jsi will generate it again next time it runs. If you make changes to `~/.jsi/solvers.json` (like adding a new solver), you should delete the cache file, otherwise jsi won't pick up the new solver.


### Rich Output

jsi uses [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to render nice colored output. However importing rich at startup adds about 30-40ms to jsi's startup time, so by default jsi only uses rich if it detects that its output is a tty.

> [!TIP]
> if you want to minimize jsi's startup time, you can force it to use basic output by redirecting its stderr to a file: `jsi ... 2> jsi.out`


### Run a specific sequence of solvers

Sometimes it can be useful to run only a subset of available solvers, for instance when you already know the top 2-3 solvers for a given problem.

jsi supports a `--sequence` option that allows you to specify a sequence of solvers to run as a comma-separated list of solver names (as defined in your `~/.jsi/solvers.json` file).

## Development

Pre-requisites: install [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/#installing-rye)

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/a16z/jsi
cd jsi

# install dependencies
rye sync

# runs the formatter, linter, type checker and tests
rye run all

# run the tool
rye run jsi --help

# run it without rye
python -m jsi --help

# run a single test
uv run pytest -v -k <test_name>
```

### Redirect log output

```sh
# jsi will print its own output to stderr, so you can redirect it to a file
# (stdout is reserved for the best solver's output)
jsi 2> jsi.logs
```


### Profiling imports

```sh
# this will print import times to stderr
python -Ximporttime -m jsi ... 2> stderr.log

# this parses the log and displays a nice visual summary
uvx tuna stderr.log
```


### Benchmarking

I recommend using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) to benchmark jsi.

For instance, to verify that redirecting stderr improves startup time, you can do:

```sh
# this only runs the "always-sat" virtual solver to evaluate jsi's overhead
hyperfine --warmup 3 --shell=none 'python -m jsi examples/easy-sat.smt2 --sequence always-sat'
```
